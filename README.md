### Project Overview

Given 6 CSV files with employee information at a certain company, the goal of this project was to design tables in Postgres to hold the information provided by the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and then query to answer specific questions about the data. 

In order to accompish this goal, the following steps were performed:
- Data Modeling
- Data Engineering
- Data Analysis

### Data

The original data is in the form of 6 CSV files that can be found in the [Data folder](https://github.com/jobrien1726/sql-challenge/tree/master/Data) above.

### Data Engineering

The first step is inspecting the files and sketching an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) of the tables. The visual representation of the database relations ERD is created using a [free online source](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com).
